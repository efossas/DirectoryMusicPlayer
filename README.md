# Directory Music Player

A simple way to turn a directory of mp3 files into an online music player

## Install

Just add index.php & mp3player into the directory with the music.

## Usage

Just go to the directory url. You can add `?shuffle` to shuffle the music's order.

## Notes

Everything is already minimized. The player is responsive so it should look good on mobile.
